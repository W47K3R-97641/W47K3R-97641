**Aspiring .NET Developer | EDM Lover | Walkers Community Member**

Hi! I'm Amar Chadli, a passionate learner on a journey to become a professional software developer, specializing in **C# and .NET Core**. My fascination with technology started with games like *Watch Dogs*, and artists like **Alan Walker**, who inspired me to blend creativity with code.

I'm deeply interested in building clean, efficient, and meaningful software, and I believe continuous learning is the key to growth. Whether it's back-end logic or front-end design, I love solving problems and making ideas real.
